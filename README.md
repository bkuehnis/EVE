# Welcome to the EVE Framework

The release of version 1.2 updates EVE to Unity 2018 and adds features we developed over the last year. Below you find the tutorial for your first experiment with EVE. If you decide to work with EVE, you can also join our Q&A site and read the paper below.

Warning: There may be a slight issue with the MySQL Database when trying to generate a build. Please contact us for further instructions in case you bump into issues there.

## Tutorials

We will provide you with a series of tutorials to get acquainted with all aspects of EVE. For now, there is only one tutorial showing you the basics.

 * [Tutorial 1: Visiting the Viking Village](https://www.files.ethz.ch/cog/EVE_tutorial.pdf)

## Q&A

We have set up a [Q&A site for EVE](https://eve.qhub.com/) where you can ask questions about anything EVE related. Whether you want to know if a certaine experiment could be run with EVE or you have questions about a particular feature of EVE, we are there to help you. If you would like to suggest a new feature, you can create an [issue on our github repository](https://github.com/cog-ethz/EVE/issues).
