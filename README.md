# Welcome to the EVE Framework

The release of version 1.0.02 fixes some minor bugs, please find it on the [release page](https://github.com/cog-ethz/EVE/releases) and download `EVE_v1.1.0.2.zip`. Below you find the tutorial for your first experiment with EVE. If you decide to work with EVE, you can also join our Q&A site and read the paper below.

## Tutorials

We will provide you with a series of tutorials to get acquainted with all aspects of EVE. For now, there is only one tutorial showing you the basics.

## Question & Answers

We just opened a [Stack Exchange Q&A portal for EVE](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/115990/eve-framework?referrer=PBgu_LoRXkpXghTbSWiqQg2). Currently, the page is in the "definition phase", which means that you can ask example questions and vote on which questions you would like to have answers. If you are interested in using EVE, please consider signing up and asking example questions. This will allow us to move to the next stage where we can answer those questions and interact with users like you.
